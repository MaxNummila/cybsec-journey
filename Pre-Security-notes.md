# TryHackMe Pre-Security path Notes

This file covers my progress and what I have learned from the **Pre-Security** path



## Path Overview

**Modules Completed:**
- Introduction to Cyber Security
- Network Fundamentals
- How the Web Works
- Linux Fundamentals 1-3
- Windows Fundamentals 1-3

**Skills Gained:**
- Basic command-line skills (Linux)
- Understanding how websites and servers communicate and work
- Network structures, IP addressing, DNS and protocols



## Key Concepts

### Introduction to Cyber Security
- CIA triad: Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability
- Threats, vulnerabilities and attacks
- Common roles in cybersecurity

### Network Fundamentals
#### IP Addresses:
- IPv4 and IPv6
- Public vs Private IPs
- Subnetting basics
#### Protocols and Ports
- Common ports:
  - 80 (HTTP), 443 (HTTPS), 22 (SSH), 21 (FTP), 53 (DNS)
- TCP vs UDP
- OSI Model layers

### How the Web Works
- Websites use the **client-server model**
- HTTP/HTTPS
- DNS for making IP addresses easier to remember
- Key tools: `whois`, `nslookup`, `dig`

### Linux Fundamentals (1-3)
#### Basic commands:
- `ls`, `cd`, `pwd`, `cat`, `touch`, `mkdir`, `rm`, `cp`, `mv`
- `man` for help: `man ls`  
#### Permissions:
- `chmod`, `chown`, and `ls -l` to view permissions
- File types: `-` (file), `d` (directory), `l` (symlink)
#### Navigation and searching:
- `find`, `grep`, `less`, `head`, `tail`
#### User management:
- `adduser`, `passwd`, `su`, `sudo`, `groups`

### Windows Fundamentals (1-3)
#### System information:
- Services, registry, file system
- `winver`, `systeminfo` and control panel
#### File system and navigation
#### System Configuration

## Own thoughts and findings
- Surprising amount of good labs and tasks which gave a good basic refresh on all the fundamentals.
- Only real learning done was in the Linux fundamentals part, which I found really interesting since I have gained an interest in Linux as of late.
- The windows fundamentals were really underwhelming compared to the linux ones, especially since I am used to windows. Only part 3 felt like it had somewhat new and interesting tools to me.

 CheatSheet:
 Nothing real noteworthy except linux commands which also excist in OverTheWire bandit logs
 `ssh`
 `grep`
 `whois`
